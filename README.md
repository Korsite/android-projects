These are some projects I made in android studio while studying jetpack compose, in order to use them, android studio is required

AnimeQuiz is an application that displays pictures of different characters of anime in 3 levels -> EASY, MEDIUM and DIFFICULT;
user has to know the name of that character in order to earn points, since a character
might have more than a name, user can write any of them to get the answer correct. 
User can skip any character, but this will substract a bit amount of points (negative points is not possible).
Have shown 10 characters will instantly end the game, if the necessary amount of points were enough 
then user can go to next level, otherwise same level is repeated

ReynosaApp is an application that shows restaurants/schools/supermarkets/parks/Info and more about Reynosa city,
regardless not all places are shown, some genders are finished of places (for example restaurants)
